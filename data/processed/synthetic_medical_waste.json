    "question": "Where should I dispose of a used needle after giving an injection?",
    "answer": "Used needles must be disposed of immediately in an approved sharps container that is puncture-resistant, leak-proof, and labeled with the biohazard symbol, per OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030).

    "question": "What should I do if a sharps container is almost full?",
    "answer": "Sharps containers should be replaced according to facility policy and before they reach the fill line, typically around three-quarters full.
